## General-info:
The ventilation slider is a very useful tool for ventilation system designers and is used for quick calculations of ventilation system parameters. This program calculates following parameters:
Flow parameters - calculates the air velocity, after selecting the dimensions of the duct, the application gives the design air velocity.
Duct cross-section - performs the calculation of the duct cross-section (with circular and rectangular cross-section), based on the set dimensions.
Volume flow rate - performs the calculation of volume flow based on the given duct cross-section and air velocity. 


### Technologies:
Project is created with: 
* Python 3.0
* Tkinter
